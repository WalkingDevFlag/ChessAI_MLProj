# Chess Project Repository

## Overview
This repository contains components for a chess-related project. It is structured into multiple folders, each serving a unique purpose. The project includes a standalone chess GUI, UCI-compliant chess engines, and a self-play data generator for chess training and analysis.

## Features

### Folder 1: Chess GUI
- A standalone chess graphical user interface (GUI) built for easy visualization of chess games.
- No built-in chess engine; supports manual moves for players.

### Folder 2: Simple Chess Engine (UCI Format)
- Implements a basic chess engine adhering to the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol.
- Can be connected to GUI software supporting UCI engines for playing chess.

### Folder 3: Self-Playing Chess Engine
- An advanced chess engine capable of playing games against itself.
- Designed for generating chess game data for training and analytical purposes.
- Outputs move sequences and evaluations for further use.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Running the Chess GUI
1. Navigate to the GUI folder:
   ```bash
   will update
   ```
2. Run the GUI script:
   ```bash
   will update
   ```

### Using the Simple Chess Engine
1. Navigate to the engine folder:
   ```bash
   will update
   ```
2. Start the engine in UCI mode:
   ```bash
   will update
   ```
3. Connect it to a UCI-compatible GUI (e.g., Arena or Scid vs. PC).

### Running the Self-Playing Chess Engine
1. Navigate to the self-play engine folder:
   ```bash
   will update
   ```
2. Start the self-play process:
   ```bash
   will update
   ```
3. Generated data will be saved in the specified output directory (configure in `config.json`).
